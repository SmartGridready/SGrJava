## Getting Started

Let's say you are a developer that wants to have its software communicate with a SmartGrid ready® certified device to read values and control its functions. Thanks to SmartGrid ready&reg; this translates into a few simple steps:

1. Generate an **External Interface** for the selected communication type in your specific programming language. *For example EI4_Modbus*
2. Generate a new **Generic Interface** in your specific programming language for your device. *For example generate a Generic Interface for a Meter Device*
3. Done! Now your software is able to communicate and control the device.
